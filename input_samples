He go home at morning
I submit report to professor
I was made hit in America
I won't forget when you said to me "stay gold"
She want to do task due to next week
Michael does not work at his home
let's do after a week
Stand by me
He who is playing on horse must return by tonight
Noah went into the oasis
There was a ghost behind him at morning
I’m going to finish homework within a week
I climb up Mt Fuji
We can take a rest until the a bell rings
I’m waiting for him underneath the park tree
There is a danger box under the bridge
We going to go toward the river after We finish eating lunch
 You can arrive him house by turning to the right
We can stay to ten o'clock in the hotel
Children can go to park to play with friends from dusk till dawn
Japan is famous throughout the world
I want to live with no ill throughout my life
We stayed awake to finish our homework through the night
